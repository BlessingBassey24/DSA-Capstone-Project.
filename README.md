- There's a very low patronage of office products
- Toys and games had the lowest revenue

- Electronices and computer assesosries had the highest rating count
### Recommendation
- Based on the above analysis, I'll recommend that:
- Amazon should focus more on Electronics because it generates the highest revenue for the company
- Also, the company should improve on making sure to improve the quality of office product, toys&games and other product with less patronage
- The company should encourage customers to leave reviews for office products and toys&games because positive reviews help increase visibility and drive sales
- Amazon should also utilize the success of electronics by cross-promoting other products. They should consider bunding electronics with office products or offering discount for customers who purchase mulitple products.
- For a better marketing strategies, Amazon should counsider using Amazon Fulfilment (FBA) to improve shiping times and customer satisfaction.
### Conclusion
By implementing the above recommendation, the company can potentially improve sales, increase customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth.
